<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<h3>Web and How it Works</h3>
<p>The web is a network of computers that communicate with each other. Computers send a HTTP Request to a server to grab appropriate webpages that you search on a browser. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. </p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". </p><p> - Text taken from Andy's Webpage notes</p>

<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.</p><p> - Text taken from Andy's Webpage notes</p>
<h3> Stupid Computers</h3>
<p>Computers  interpret instructions literally. So anything you put in is interpretted as such. Forgetting a comma is deadly.</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
HTML elements are either <em>INLINE</em> or <b>BLOCK</b>. 
<ul>
  <li><em>Inline</em> elemnts are displayed without line breaks</li>
  <li><b>Block</b> elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</li></ul>
